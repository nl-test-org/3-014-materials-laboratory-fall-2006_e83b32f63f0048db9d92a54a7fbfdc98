3.014 fulfills the institute communication requirement (CI-M) through a combination of written and oral reporting on experiments performed in the class.

For each of the four lab weeks, students will report on one of the three experiments performed that week as designated by the instructors. For weeks 1-3, the report is due at the end the week following the lab. For week 4, a final written exam will be given during finals week on material covered in Lab week 4, with only the student's lab notebook serving as a reference. Guidelines and examples of the report formats are provided below.

In addition to the four reports, students will be graded on their lab notebooks and participation in mandatory interactive recitations.
